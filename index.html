            I am a guitarist with a foundation in jazz and folk music. I have a Bachelor of Jazz Studies from the University of Manitoba, where I studied under guitarist Larry Roy and had the privilege of sharing the stage with other world-class musicians, such as American saxophonist Jon Gordon. My time at university was as much about the music as it was about learning how to apply myself and understand the commitment required to be a musician. To build on these skills, I completed a graduate certificate in Music Composition at Humber College under media composer Ari Posner and pianist Nancy Wilson, where I developed a fuller understanding of music production and how music works sonically.

            My professional music career has spanned a wide variety of settings, from the theater to the sea. Highlights include touring with the Broadway musical "Chicago" and working as a house band guitarist for Princess Cruises where I was based in Los Angeles and sailed to ports around North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. I also toured the Canadian Prairies with vocalist Woody Holler and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Koulack and performed as a sideman for acts such as the Big City All Star Band, Walle Larsson, and big-band leader Ron Paley. In addition to performing, I spent meaningful time in Northern Manitoba teaching Metis trad guitar accompaniment with the Frontier School Division. My work has been supported through collaborations with the Canada Council for the Arts and the Manitoba Arts Council, as well as the Screen Composers Guild of Canada, where I completed a 2022 mentorship under composer Virginia Kilbertus.

            In addition to my music career, I hold a Master of Public Policy and currently work for the Government of Canada. After graduating from my Masters program in 2024, I was accepted into the prestigious Advanced Policy Analyst Program, and will complete this professional development in July 2026. This dual path has given me a broad outlook and allows me to bring a unique perspective to the arts, balancing public policy and economics with music performance. Now based in Ottawa, I am excited to be immersing myself in the city's vibrant trad music scene and continue to evolve my sound on the guitar.
