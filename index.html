                <h3 class="sub-section">Education</h3>
                <p>I am a guitarist with a foundation in jazz and composition. I have a Bachelor of Jazz Studies from the University of Manitoba, where I studied privately under guitarist Larry Roy and played with world-class musicians, such as saxophonist Jon Gordon. To build on these skills, I completed a graduate certificate in Music Composition at Humber College under composer Ari Posner and pianist Nancy Wilson. Afterwards, I completed the Screen Composers Guild of Canada mentorship program under composer Virginia Kilbertus.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section">Professional Career</h3>
                <p>Highlights from my professional music career include touring with the Broadway musical "Chicago" and working as a house band guitarist for Princess Cruises, where I was based in Los Angeles and sailed to ports around the Americas. I also toured the Prairies playing Western Swing with Woody Holler and Daniel Koulack and performed as a sideman for the Big City All Star Band, Walle Larsson, and Ron Paley. I also taught and played Metis trad guitar in Northern Manitoba with the Frontier School Division. My music has been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Manitoba Arts Council.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-section">Move to Ottawa</h3>
                <p>In addition to my music career, I hold a Master of Public Policy and work for the Government of Canada. After graduating from my master's program in 2024, I was accepted into the prestigious Advanced Policy Analyst Program, and will complete this professional development in July 2026. This dual path has given me a broad outlook and allows me to bring a unique perspective to the arts, balancing public policy and economics with music performance. Now based in Ottawa, I am excited to be immersing myself in the city's vibrant trad music scene and continue to evolve my sound on the guitar.</p>
