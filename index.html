                    I am a guitarist with a foundation in jazz and folk music. I have a Bachelor of Jazz Studies from the University of Manitoba, where I studied under guitarist Larry Roy and shared the stage with world-class musicians such as American saxophonist Jon Gordon.

                    My time at university was as much about the music as it was about learning how to apply myself and understand the commitment required to be a musician. To build on these skills, I completed a graduate certificate in Music Composition at Humber College under media composer Ari Posner and pianist Nancy Wilson, where I developed a fuller understanding of music production and how music works sonically.

                    "My professional career has spanned a wide variety of settings, from the theater to the sea, touring with 'Chicago' and sailing the Caribbean as a house guitarist for Princess Cruises."

                    I also toured the Canadian Prairies with vocalist Woody Holler and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Koulack, performing as a sideman for acts such as the Big City All Star Band and Ron Paley. In addition to performing, I spent meaningful time in Northern Manitoba teaching Metis trad guitar accompaniment with the Frontier School Division. My work has been supported through collaborations with the Canada Council for the Arts and the Screen Composers Guild of Canada.

                    Beyond the music, I hold a Master of Public Policy and currently work for the Government of Canada in the Advanced Policy Analyst Program. Now based in <strong>Ottawa</strong>, I am excited to be immersing myself in the city's vibrant trad music scene and continue to evolve my sound on the guitar.
