                    <h3 class="sub-section">Professional Career</h3>
                    <p>I am a guitarist with a foundation in jazz and composition. Highlights from my professional music career include touring with the Broadway musical "Chicago" and working as a house band guitarist for Princess Cruises, where I was based in Los Angeles and sailed to ports around the Americas. I also toured the Prairies playing Western Swing with Woody Holler and Daniel Koulack, performed as a sideman for acts such as the Big City All Star Band, Walle Larsson, and Ron Paley, and taught and played Metis trad guitar in Northern Manitoba with the Frontier School Division. My music has been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts and the Manitoba Arts Council.</p>

                    <h3 class="sub-section">Education</h3>
                    <p>I have a Bachelor of Jazz Studies from the University of Manitoba, where I studied privately under guitarist Larry Roy and played with world-class musicians, such as saxophonist Jon Gordon and vibraphonist Stefan Bauer. To build on these skills, I completed a graduate certificate in Music Composition at Humber College under composer Ari Posner and pianist Nancy Wilson and was accepted shortly after graduation into the Screen Composers Guild of Canada mentorship program, studying under composer Virginia Kilbertus.</p>

                    <h3 class="sub-section">Move to Ottawa</h3>
                    <p>In addition to my music career and education, I hold a Master of Public Policy and Administration and work for the Government of Canada. Now based in Ottawa, I am excited to be immersing myself in the city's vibrant trad and fiddle music scene and continue to evolve my sound on the guitar.</p>
