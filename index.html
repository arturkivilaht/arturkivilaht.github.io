                        I am a guitarist with a foundation in jazz and folk music. I have a Bachelor of Jazz Studies from the University of Manitoba, where I studied under guitarist Larry Roy and had the privilege of sharing the stage with other world-class musicians, such as American saxophonist Jon Gordon.

                        My time at university was as much about the music as it was about learning how to apply myself and understand the commitment required to be a musician. To build on these skills, I completed a graduate certificate in Music Composition at Humber College under media composer Ari Posner and pianist Nancy Wilson, where I developed a fuller understanding of music production and how music works sonically.

                            From Broadway to the Caribbean, my professional career has spanned international theater tours and residencies on the sea, performing alongside acts like the Big City All Star Band and Ron Paley.

                        Beyond the stage, I hold a Master of Public Policy and currently serve the Government of Canada as part of the Advanced Policy Analyst Program. This dual path allows me to bring a unique perspective to the arts, balancing public policy and economics with high-level music performance.
